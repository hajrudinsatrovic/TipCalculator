## TipCalculator
***
Simple app that takes in user input and calculates how much a user should tip based on the bill and how much percentage they wish to tip. 

## JavaScript Features
***
Document Object Model (DOM)
The DOM gives JavaScript access to the HTML document. The DOM is a built-in object with functions for
manipulating the HTML. The DOM converts HTML elements into JavaScript objects. 

In this app, we use document objects that access element objects via getElementById(id).
These element objects are the JS models of the HTML elements from the web page.
